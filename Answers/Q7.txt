In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest stirs, and night's awake today.
Trees stand tall, like sentinels of old,
Their leaves rustling secrets yet untold.

A brook babbles on, with gentle voice,
Weaving tales of earth and heavenly choice.
Its crystal waters dance upon the shore,
Reflecting sunbeams that no longer pour.

The wind whispers low, through whispering grass,
As morning dew, like diamonds, clings to pass.
And in the distance, mountains rise high,
Their grandeur awe-inspiring, touching the sky.

In nature's symphony, we find our peace,
A world of wonder, beauty to release.
Where trees stand guard, and creatures roam free,
We find a sense of calm, wild and carefree.

As stars appear, in midnight's darkest hue,
And moonlight glows, with silvery dew,
The world is hushed, in quiet reverie,
Inviting us to connect, with nature's mystery.

So let us wander, through forests deep and wide,
To listen to the whispers of the earth inside.
For in its ancient heart, a wisdom lies in store,
A symphony of life, forever to adore.
