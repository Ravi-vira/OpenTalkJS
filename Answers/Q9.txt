**Code Documentation Guidelines**

This document outlines the guidelines for writing clear and concise code documentation. The purpose of code documentation is to provide a clear understanding of the code's functionality, behavior, and maintenance requirements.

**Documentation Style**

The recommended style for code documentation is the Google Style Guide (GSG). This guide provides a set of conventions and best practices for writing readable and maintainable code comments.

### Comment Structure

A comment should start with a blank line to separate it from the surrounding code. The format of a comment is as follows:

```
# Brief description of the function or variable
## Detailed explanation of the functionality or behavior
### Additional information or context
```

### Comment Examples

*   Function documentation:
    ```python
def greet(name):
    """
    Returns a greeting message for the given name.
    
    Args:
        name (str): The name to use in the greeting.
    
    Returns:
        str: A greeting message.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

*   Variable documentation:
    ```python
MAX_SIZE = 1024  # Maximum size of a buffer in bytes

# Example usage:
buffer_size = MAX_SIZE
if buffer_size > 1000:
    print("Buffer too large!")
else:
    print("Buffer is small enough!")
```

### Best Practices

*   Keep comments concise and focused on the functionality or behavior.
*   Use clear and descriptive language.
*   Avoid excessive commenting. Comments should be used to explain the code, not to duplicate it.
*   Use Markdown formatting for headings and lists.
*   Include a clear description of any complex logic or algorithms.

**Tools for Code Documentation**

There are several tools available that can help with code documentation, including:

*   Sphinx: A popular tool for generating documentation from comments in Python code.
*   Javadoc: A Java-specific tool for generating documentation from comments and annotations.
*   Doxygen: A general-purpose tool for generating documentation from comments.

**Best Practices for Using Code Documentation Tools**

*   Use the recommended format and style for your comments.
*   Ensure that all comments are properly formatted and consistent throughout the codebase.
*   Test the generated documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the code's functionality and behavior.
*   Regularly update the documentation to reflect changes to the code.

By following these guidelines and best practices, you can create clear and concise code documentation that helps other developers understand your code and maintain it over time.
