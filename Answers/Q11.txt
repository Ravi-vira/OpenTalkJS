**Bug Report**

**Title:** Incorrect Calculation of Interest Rate for Investment Portfolio

**Version:** 1.2.3

**Platform:** Windows 10, macOS High Sierra

**Browser:** Google Chrome 92.0.4515.107

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create a new investment portfolio with an initial balance of $100,000.
2. Add two different investments: one with a 5% annual interest rate and another with a 10% annual interest rate.
3. Set the time period for the investments to be 6 months.
4. Click on the "Calculate" button.

**Expected Results:** The program should display the updated balance for each investment after 6 months, taking into account the calculated interest rates.

**Observed Results:**

1. The initial balance is displayed correctly as $100,000.
2. However, when calculating the interest rate for both investments, the program incorrectly applies a fixed interest rate of 5% to the entire portfolio instead of applying the individual interest rates.
3. As a result, the updated balance for the investment with the 10% annual interest rate is displayed as $110,000, while it should be around $105,000.
